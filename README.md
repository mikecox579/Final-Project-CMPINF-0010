### Datasets
[Employment](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/fd095080-d32c-4669-8b62-c80f4f32723a)- This dataset looks at residents of 16+ year olds employed in each Pittsburgh neighborhood, and also breaks it down according to the industry of employment.

[Education](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/f7b19c6c-aa66-419b-b0e1-9998d7ddfcbc)- This dataset shows the qualifications that people have in each neighborhood determined by their education level.

[Built Environment Condition](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/61a264ec-a537-42de-91e3-5752d689103d)- This dataset provided everything necessary to rank each neighborhood based on the number of code violations each neighborhood received and the approximate number of structures in each neighborhood. Also, it provided information regarding population, demolitions, condemned structures, building quality, etc.

### Abstract
Through our research and calculations we found that Shadyside was the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We determined the best neighborhood by looking at the highest rate of education, employment, and the least code violations. Shadyside was top 10 in each individual metric, and with this data combined and weighted evenly Shadyside came out to be our clear winner.
